## 🎯 Performance Optimizations

### Core Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed
- **Image Optimization**: Responsive images with proper sizing
- **Animation Performance**: GPU-accelerated animations with hardware acceleration
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting with Create React App

### Animation Performance Enhancements
- **Hardware Acceleration**: All animations use `transform3d()` and `will-change` properties
- **Reduced Particle Count**: Optimized particle systems (6 grid lines, 8 particles vs. 12/20)
- **Simplified Animations**: Linear easing for better performance, removed expensive blur filters
- **GPU Compositing**: Forced GPU layers for glassmorphism and neon effects
- **Memory Management**: Predictable animation patterns and optimized delays

### CSS Performance Features
- **Custom Performance CSS**: Dedicated stylesheet with hardware acceleration classes
- **Containment**: CSS containment for layout and style optimization
- **Backface Visibility**: Hidden backfaces to prevent unnecessary renders
- **Shape Rendering**: Optimized SVG rendering with `optimizeSpeed`
- **Text Rendering**: Speed-optimized text rendering for countdown elements

### Performance Monitoring
- **Real-time FPS Monitor**: Development-only performance tracking
- **Memory Usage Tracking**: JavaScript heap size monitoring
- **Frame Rate Optimization**: Maintains 15-60 FPS on average hardware
